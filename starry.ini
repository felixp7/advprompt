[CONFIG]
max_score = 25.0
banner = It's so close to the road, yet so far from civilization, and nobody seems to know much about it. It's been taunting you for months. But its secrets will not last much longer. You are ready.
use_score = True

[tentflap]
description = A small but sturdy triangle tent, its canvas brightly colored.
success = You bend down and crawl into the tent.
name = your tent
type = scenery
location = rbank
link = tent

[up-cave-d]
lock = -lantern
name = down
type = exit
location = up-cave
failure = No way you're climbing down a rope with lantern in hand.
link = low-cave

[rbank-s]
lock = !boat
name = south
type = exit
location = rbank
failure = You can't exactly row a boat up a rocky trail.
link = roadside

[low-cave]
description = Countless points of light dot the high ceiling of the cavern, framing the jagged teeth of stalactites and stalagmites in the background. An underground lake take up most of the floor, leaving only a narrow ledge along what must be the south side. Off to the east, all that water flows noisily down a tunnel, while in the opposite direction lies a maze of confusing passages. But there's no way to miss the rope climbing upwards through a hole.
link = karst
drop = There's a splash in the water below. As you squint, a slightly darker spot is being carried east by the current, but that's probably your imagination.
type = room
score = 5.0
name = Lower cavern

[aerie]
description = It's a tall, narrow room where every wall bears the mark of tools, and fossilized wood splinters crunch underfoot. High above, cracks in the rock admit slivers of daylight; the air is dry, and not as cold as down in the tunnel.
type = room
name = Aerie

[nook-se]
type = exit
location = nook
link = low-cave
name = southeast

[up-cave-u]
type = exit
location = up-cave
link = aerie
name = up

[roadside]
description = You parked your SUV not far from the road, not hidden, but discreetly. Seldom does the growl of a passing car break up the wind singing in the treetops, but the smell of exhaust persists, clashing with the perfume of green needles.
type = room
name = Roadside

[roadside-se]
lock = +chest
success = You unlock the car, and proceed to hide your finding at the bottom of the spacious trunk. Opening it can wait. When you look up again, someone else is there...
name = pack up
type = exit
location = roadside
failure = You're too ambitious to go home without any treasure from the cave.
link = the-end

[nook]
description = Broken slabs of rock leaning against the wall and each other mask a recess right off the main cavern. Here and there, puddles of bone-chilling water on the uneven ground shimmer eerily, reflecting the fake stars above.
type = room
name = Hidden nook

[up-cave-s]
light = True
type = exit
location = up-cave
link = lbank
name = south

[rbank]
description = The pine trees shy away from the bank here, leaving enough room to pitch a tent. The riverbed is broad and deep, making the water calm enough to row safely despite the strong current. Straight across, the cave mouth beckons with its darkness-shrouded mysteries, while behind the tent to the south a rocky trail vanishes into the forest.
type = room
name = Right riverbank

[roadside-n]
type = exit
location = roadside
link = rbank
name = north

[low-cave-nw]
type = exit
location = low-cave
dark = True
link = nook
name = northwest

[cave-m]
description = 
type = scenery
location = lbank
link = up-cave
name = cave mouth

[aerie-d]
type = exit
location = aerie
link = up-cave
name = down

[lbank-sw]
lock = ?boat
name = southwest
type = exit
location = lbank
failure = Swimming in a cold mountain river? No thanks.
link = rbank

[boat]
description = It's a small inflatable row boat that cost you an equally small fortune. But no matter, soon it will all pay off.
type = vehicle
location = rbank
name = inflatable boat

[karst]
description = Water gushes out through a crevice in the mountain side, and pools into a small basin before flowing into the river at the far end. Fallen branches form an impromptu net that catches all kinds of floating debris, not far from the path.
type = room
name = Karst spring

[chest]
description = It's a treasure chest just like in pirate movies, except very small and light. Sturdy, too, despite that.
type = thing
score = 10.0
location = nook
name = Treasure chest

[map]
description = The paint is faded, and the lines shaky, but the map can only depict the cave system. You recognize the entrance tunnel and this room. A certain passage off a grand hall is clearly marked.
score = 5.0
name = mural map
type = text
location = aerie
link = low-cave-nw

[up-cave]
description = Daylight duly dwindles away from the cave mouth. Cold moisture in the air clings to the skin; the walls shine wetly in the electric glare.
success = You forgot your rope in the SUV, but there is one already, clinging to the floor of an abrupt slide into darkness. Rough steps climb around a pillar in which someone carved a little shelf.
name = Upper cavern
type = room
dark = True
failure = Daylight duly dwindles away from the cave mouth, as the tunnel twists and turns. Soon, your own echoing footsteps are the only guide in the darkness.

[lbank-e]
lock = !boat
name = east
type = exit
location = lbank
failure = You can't exactly row a boat up a rocky trail.
link = karst

[lbank]
description = The ground raises abruptly away from the bank, unbroken but for a hole in the mountainside not far up. Towards the east, a narrow footpath follows the water downstream. Moist ground yields underfoot with every step, and the sound of running water echoes from all sides.
type = room
name = Left riverbank

[karst-w]
type = exit
location = karst
link = lbank
name = west

[low-cave-u]
lock = -chest
name = up
type = exit
location = low-cave
failure = No way you're going to climb a rope while carrying a treasure chest.
link = up-cave

[lantern]
description = It's a heavy-duty electric lantern. You changed the batteries just this morning.
score = 5.0
name = Electric lantern
light = True
type = thing
location = tent
initial = Your heavy-duty electric lantern is hanging from a hook.

[the-end]
description = "Congratulations!" shouts the funnily-dressed man who just climbed out of a van. You never heard it coming. "You are the first winner of our new reality show! I would invite you to claim your prize, but you already have it. Tell me, how does it feel?" The woman in a business suit who is with him flashes an embarrassed smile. "We should probably mention that you are on camera."
type = room
ending = True
success = And that's when things started taking a turn for the weirder...
name = Surprise!

[tent-o]
type = exit
location = tent
link = rbank
name = out

[ball]
description = It's damp, but otherwise in decent condition, everything considered.
type = thing
location = karst
drop = You let go of the ball.
name = tennis ball

[rbank-ne]
lock = ?boat
name = northeast
type = exit
location = rbank
failure = Swimming in a cold mountain river? No thanks.
link = lbank

[tent]
description = The tent has room for little more than a bedroll, but then your SUV isn't far away either. It will do for a day or two.
type = room
name = Your tent

[hero]
description = Look at you, all kitted out in the best gear money can buy. (Not that you know how to use half of it, but shush!) Too bad there's no-one around to admire you.
type = actor
location = rbank
name = A proud mountaineer
