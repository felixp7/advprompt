[study]
name = Wizard's study
type = room
description = Curtains dyed a leafy brown adorn the stone walls, otherwise bare but for the furniture leaning against them: a large, ornate writing desk near the window, a bed on the opposite side and, facing the door, a little bookshelf.

[pocket-book]
name = pocket book
