[heavy-book]
name = heavy book
type = thing
location = niche
description = Embossed leather covers wrap a massive tome with a title to match: "On the system for authoring fiction of the interactive persuasion known as Adventure Prompt: a cursory overview of its structure and goals, by Eoghan the Wizard". The table of contents alone stretches on for many pages, but a number of topics stand out.
score = 10

[advprompt]
name = Adventure Prompt
type = topic
location = heavy-book
description = Adventure Prompt is a system of magic you can use to make living worlds just like the one you are in right now. To this end, you'll write down everything there is to be found in your world, and the properties of each object, then perform the proper invocation on the resulting codex.

[intfic]
name = interactive fiction
type = topic
location = heavy-book
description = Interactive fiction is the art of creating worlds one can explore out of just written prose, like the one you are in right now. It's all the pleasure of reading, with the added appeal of letting the reader unconver hidden corners all by themselves, and sometimes even influencing if not changing the story.

[goals]
name = goals
type = topic
location = advprompt
description = Adventure Prompt makes it easy to create old-school interactive fiction, with brief writing and simple structure, such that it can be played by pointing at what you want to do, as opposed to knowing the right words to say at every turn. Thus the old and the new meet again.

[objects]
name = objects
type = topic
location = advprompt
description = Objects make up everything in Adventure Prompt. Any story made with it needs to contain at least two: a special actor known as the hero, and a room for the actor to be located in (where "room" is of course meant in a loose sense). A few other types of objects exist, each with their own behavior.

[properties]
name = properties
type = topic
location = advprompt
description = All objects in Adventure Prompt need at least a name and a type (the identifier isn't really a property). Apart from that, most objects will have a description, and all except rooms should have a location, if not from the start then later in the game, otherwise they'll be inaccessible. Other important properties that apply to most objects include the initial description, the link, the lock, and the various flags.

[flags]
name = flags
type = topic
location = properties
description = Flags are simply properties with a true/false value. They mark things such as whether an object is visible at all, or emits light; also whether it's been interacted with already, or if interacting with it causes the story to end. The value of some flags can even change during the game.

[invocation]
name = invocation
type = topic
location = advprompt
description = There are two ways to invoke Adventure Prompt: either as a last step after writing everything down, or else as an ongoing process that lets you build the world as you go, by giving commands born of another old tradition. Which one you choose will depend on your preferences; you'll always be able to go back and forth while working on a story.
